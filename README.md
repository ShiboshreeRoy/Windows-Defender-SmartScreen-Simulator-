# üõ°Ô∏è Windows Defender SmartScreen Simulator  
**Version 1.0** | Developed by [Shiboshree Roy](https://github.com/shiboshreeroy)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer**: This project is for **educational and demonstration purposes only**. It must only be executed on systems **you own or have explicit permission to test**. The developer is **not responsible** for any misuse or damage caused by the code.

## üìò Overview

This Python script simulates the **Microsoft Defender SmartScreen** warning window using `tkinter`. The project is meant to demonstrate how social engineering, UI spoofing, and persistence mechanisms could be visually represented ‚Äî for **security research**, **user awareness training**, or **ethical demonstrations**.

When executed, it:

- Requests admin privileges (via UAC)
- Displays a realistic SmartScreen UI overlay
- Executes a payload if the user chooses "Run anyway"
- Adds a persistent entry in the Windows Registry (`HKCU\Run`)

## ‚ú® Features

| Category | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| üîê **Stealth Operation** | Hidden console window, UAC elevation, silent failover |
| üíª **Authentic UI** | Simulates Microsoft Defender SmartScreen with matching font, colors (`#005a9e`), and hover effects |
| üß† **Persistence** | Adds registry startup key as `WindowsUpdateService` |
| üõ†Ô∏è **Payload Execution** | Executes external payload executable on user action |
| üß© **Customizable** | Easily editable for text, colors, sizes, and behavior |

## üß∞ Usage Instructions

### üîß 1. Customize the File Paths
Edit the script with the paths to your own test payload and log file:
```python
payload_path = r'C:\PATH\TO\payload.exe'
log_file = r'C:\PATH\TO\command_log.txt'
````

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è 2. Run the Script

```bash
python smartscreen_simulator.py
```

### üéÆ 3. Interact with the UI

* **Run anyway** ‚Üí Executes your payload, logs output, and hides the UI.
* **Don't run / Close** ‚Üí Safely exits without execution.

## üñºÔ∏è Visual Appearance

| Element         | Description                            |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| üé® Background   | `#005a9e` (Defender Blue)              |
| üß© UI Text      | Styled to match real Defender messages |
| ‚ùå Close Button  | Top-right, hover turns red             |
| üìå Window Style | Borderless, centered, top-most         |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customization Options

### ‚úÖ Visual Customization

Modify:

```python
window.geometry("529x500")  # Adjust size
bg="#005a9e"                # Change background color
font=("Arial", 10, "bold")  # Edit font styles
```

### üß¨ Registry Key Customization

Change the persistence key name:

```python
reg.SetValueEx(key, 'WindowsUpdateService', 0, reg.REG_SZ, script_path)
```

If needed, switch to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE` (requires full admin rights).

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

### üîì Remove Registry Persistence

```cmd
reg delete HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run /v WindowsUpdateService /f
```

### üîç Monitor Process

```cmd
tasklist /FI "IMAGENAME eq payload.exe"
```

### üìÇ Inspect Log File

Check your defined log path:

```bash
type C:\PATH\TO\command_log.txt
```

## üìé File Structure

```
main.py      # Main simulator script
README.md                     # Documentation
payload.exe                   # Your own test executable
command_log.txt               # Output log (optional)
```

## üß™ Educational Purpose Only

This script is a simulation ‚Äî it does **not** exploit any vulnerabilities or bypass real Windows security mechanisms. It's purely for:

* Security awareness training
* Ethical hacking labs
* Demonstrating spoofing risks
* UI deception research

---

## üì∑ Suggested Icons

To simulate a more authentic appearance, you can attach a `.ico` file to your `.py` script using libraries like `pyinstaller` or `pywin32`.

```bash
pyinstaller --noconsole --icon=defender.ico smartscreen_simulator.py
```
